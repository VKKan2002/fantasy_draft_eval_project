"""STEP 1 - How good are simple start/sit rules?

Metric: CAPTURE RATE = points the rule actually scored / points a perfect-hindsight
lineup would have scored, from the same roster. Bounded and interpretable:

    100%  = you started exactly the right players every week (impossible in real life)
    random = the floor, filling slots at random from who was available

The gap between the best simple rule and 100% is the ENTIRE room an AI has to work in.
If simple rules capture 95%, there is 5% left and most of it is luck.

Rosters: 12-team snake draft off point-in-time ADP, with a target composition
(2 QB, 4 RB, 4 WR, 2 TE) so every team can actually field a legal lineup. Without that,
all rules get forced into identical choices and the comparison measures nothing.

Rules all fall back to the ADP prior when a player has no games yet (week 1 especially).
