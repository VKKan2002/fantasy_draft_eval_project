"""Rule on each sentence of writer output against a facts packet.

Splitting is deterministic and happens in Python, never in the model. If the model chose
the units, they would change between runs, no two runs would be comparable, and the hand
labels - which are attached to specific sentences - would stop matching anything.

Two auditors live here, and the cheap one comes first:

  baseline_verdict()  no model at all. Does every number in the sentence appear in the
                      packet? Catches fabricated digits, misses everything about meaning.
                      This is the number the LLM auditor has to beat, and it is free.

  audit()             the LLM auditor. Not built yet - outside the current scope.

Numeric rule is Fork 1(a) from eval/LABELLING_RULES.md: a stated number matches a packet
value if the packet value ROUNDS to it at the precision the sentence used. "25" matches
25.29; "25.3" matches 25.29; "26" does not.

_RULES = """You are auditing sentences against an evidence packet.

Your ONLY question per sentence: does it follow from the packet below?
NOT whether it is true in the real world. A sentence can be perfectly true and still
fail, because the packet does not contain it.

Answer with exactly one of:
  supported      - the packet contains this, and you can name the fact or news id
  contradicted   - the packet says something incompatible with this
  not_in_packet  - the packet neither confirms nor denies it, including true things it omits
  not_a_claim    - there is no factual assertion to check (a recommendation, a hedge)

Rules:
1. NUMBERS: a stated number is supported if a packet value rounds to it at the precision
   the sentence used. "25" matches 25.29. "25.3" matches 25.29. "26" does not.
2. DATES: the packet header names one season and week. A bare present-tense claim is about
   THAT week. If a news item from an earlier season says otherwise, the current structured
   fact wins and the sentence is contradicted.
3. ATTRIBUTION: a news item supports that SOMEONE SAID something, not the thing itself.
   "The coach said he expects a normal week" is supported. "He is expected to have a normal
   week", stated bare, is not_in_packet.
4. TWO CLAIMS IN ONE SENTENCE: give the worse verdict.
   contradicted > not_in_packet > supported > not_a_claim.
5. Every "supported" needs at least one id in evidence_ids. If you cannot name the
   evidence, it is not supported.
